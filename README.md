No drive license or language certificates, before 2023 I haven't thought about these due to AS.
## What I did last year
ChatGPT released early 2023, since then I use pure English interact with it and achieves good English practice experiences, especially EECS domains. At the early time I try to design my future career, I want to immigrate outside of China.  
Because my degree align with washington accord, Australia visa type 476 give me oppertunity for work there no more than 18 month if I can proof my English professioncy (till 2023), I prioritized English ability for job finding.
