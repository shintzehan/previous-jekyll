## What I did last year
Since graduate at June 2023 from EECS dual degree program, I found myself in a huge confuse for my life, about what can I do and what kind of lifestyle I would like to live.  
And because my degree are accredited by washington accord, an international engineering program accreditation association, I was plan to apply Austrailia 476 visa for work there for a time, because Harbin's high lattitude I was depressed and anxity in a level.  
During the infomation accquization, I found myself with ability for quick language learning as an ASD (Asperger's Syndrome) person, which makes me talent in some fields, and I want to release my potential as soon as possible.
### Scania interview at April 2023
As european company, I have took an interview for job of hardware engineer based on Shanghai, And I realized my English oral speaking are highly functioning compare with vast of majority of Chinese, and as trilingual for Japanese additionally, I am very compatitive in the field that engineer work with English and / or Japanese in China, even in the period of post pandamic, most jobs are not as thought difficult for me to get.  
But in the other hand, I have to admit that I don't have enough preparation for hard core engineer job at that time, I have nothing but the degree: no intern, no project and no hobbies.
### Audio Visual System since November 2023
I joined colorlight last November as Field Application Engineer and transfer to LR optoelectronics for industry experience this April, with various bazzar issues to handle, I generally realize it is hard to be an engineer, during my working experience, the complexity for communication with people and handle issue of electronic devices are highly exceeded my exceptation.  
### Conclution for the last year
I obtained ability of EECS basics, to read schmatics and datasheet, to operate with linux cli and build project from framework like ktor, and practical language working experience for English and Japanese, Which is kind of full-filled in sort of way. Pros can be a lot because I am smart in many ways. Cons are the communication and hands-on problem which might be dangerious for me in the future.  
It's abvious that I have high potential in engineering, and to release this need time and experience.
## Plans
I want to pursue higher degree for experience of thesis and cutting-edge experience, to obtain that I need to prepare a solid knowledge and experience background, and financial support. Considering about domestic, Japan and EU region programs for that, and learning French and German can be options.
As career in engineering, I have some experience with electronic, structural and software enigneers, I felt that I curious about nearly all fiels that engineers participate in, even industry, testing and process engineers, It appears to become a range of comprehensive map of industry of electronics, and Shenzhen is indeed the hub for electronics of the world. I tend to dive into the origin field, the ECE field includes instrumentation (electromagnetic measurement), telecommunication, computer and software engineering.  
I want to earn a second bachelor degree in liberal arts, too.
