## Shenzhen experience
### I went to work in Shenzhen last year, at the most beginning I plan to be an engineer that work with English language, because Nanchang has significant optical industry as far as I know, I start my career in colorlight which an LED display control system major provider in the world.
### End-users are in a recession due to the global economic environment, which means their revenues are challengedï¼Œ I shift into another middle sided high end optoelectronic factory that are good at the latest technologies.
### Although winning competition in the international market, the R&D director told me that there were about 3,000 engineers in the entire industry in Shenzhen including structural, electrical and electronic, and about 100 like him who had become directors. He advised me to focus on sales with my excellent English skills and engineering background.
